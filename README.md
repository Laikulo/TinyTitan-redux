# TinyTitan-redux
An attempt to get tinytitan working in a nicer way

This repo contains submodules pointing to other parts of the TinyTitan system, as well as tooling used to get the system running.
 
## Current Functionality
- None

## Target Functionality
### Phase One
- Able to compile everything, and run on a pi 1 running legacy pios (old enough to work with TinySetup upstream)

### Phase Two
- Able to compile everything, and run on a pi 1(?) running current pios (trixie)

### General wishlist
- For all pis except 1: Deployment via imaging.
- Access to an "outside" network via vlans.
- Maybe netboot on pi3+s, or at least image over the network on older ones.
- RAUC?
